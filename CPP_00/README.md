## Overview

The `cpp_module_00` project is designed to introduce fundamental C++ concepts such as namespaces, classes, member functions, and basic stream handling. 

## Features

### Exercise 00: Megaphone
* Introduction to basic `stdio streams` and `string manipulation` in C++.
* Implementation of a simple program that converts input text to uppercase, demonstrating fundamental C++ `I/O operations`.

### Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook
* Exploration of `classes` and `member functions` by building a basic phonebook application.
* Understanding `data encapsulation` and the importance of managing an array of objects within a class.
* Implementation of user commands and formatted output to create an interactive console application.

### Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams
* Application of `class design` principles by recreating a missing C++ source file based on given tests and a log file.
* Reinforcement of the use of `header files` and implementation of class methods in a separate source file.
* Understanding the significance of `constructors`, `destructors`, and their order of execution within a program.

## Compilation and Execution
Each exercise should be compiled separately by running the Makefile within the corresponding exercise folder.
```bash
# Within the ex00, ex01, or ex02 directories
$>make

# Execution of ex00:
./megaphone

# Execution of ex01:
./phonebook

# Execution of ex02:
./account
```

## Tests
