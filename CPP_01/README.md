## Overview

The `cpp_module_01` project focuses on mastering essential C++ concepts such as memory allocation, pointers, references, and the switch statement through a variety of exercises.

## Features

### Exercise 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ
* Implementation of `dynamic memory allocation` and understanding the differences between stack and heap memory in C++.
* Creation of functions to manage object lifecycles, highlighting the importance of correct memory management in C++.

### Exercise 01: Moar brainz!
* Expansion of dynamic memory usage by creating and managing arrays of objects.
* Emphasis on `memory management` and ensuring no memory leaks occur when handling multiple objects.

### Exercise 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN
* Exploration of `pointers` and `references` by comparing their behavior when referencing the same data.
* Practical understanding of how memory addresses and values are managed in C++.

### Exercise 03: Unnecessary violence
* Implementation of `object composition` by creating classes that manage other objects.
* Exploration of `const references` and the implications of using pointers versus references in class design.

### Exercise 04: Sed is for losers
* File handling and string manipulation in C++, focusing on replacing text in files.
* Emphasis on using C++ standard library functions effectively while adhering to constraints on function usage.

### Exercise 05: Harl 2.0
* Introduction to `pointers to member functions` to create flexible and dynamic function calls within a class.
* Implementation of a system that automates decision-making based on input, using pointers to streamline the process.

### Exercise 06: Harl filter
* Application of the `switch statement` to filter and manage program output based on user input.
* Exploration of control flow mechanisms in C++ and their practical applications in real-world scenarios.

## Compilation and Execution
Each exercise should be compiled separately by running the Makefile within the corresponding exercise folder.
```bash
# Within the ex00, ex01, ex02, ex03, ex04, ex05, or ex06 directories
make

# Execution of ex00:
./brainz

# Execution of ex01:
./horde

# Execution of ex02:
./point_ref

# Execution of ex03:
./weapon

# Execution of ex04:
./replacer

# Execution of ex05:
./harl

# Execution of ex06:
./harlFilter
```
